# init
This is an initiation project to future DevOps projects. This is an old curriculum 42 project.

# What I learned.
This project taught me many system and network basic commands. I also made a few scripts and 
and learned about some services used on a server machine. 

# The project
This project is split into three parts:
- network
- system
- scripting
I explain each part more in detail in the exercises.
