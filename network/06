/* Get the complete path of the file that contains the ip address of the DNS server 
you're using */

I would use the command
cat /etc/resolv.conf 
which didn't actually give me the ip
address but instead gave me a command 
scutil --dns
and on the bottom of the output from this
there's a nameserver[0] address
